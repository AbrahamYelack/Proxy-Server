# Python Proxy Server
This is a lightweight Python proxy server designed to handle HTTP requests, cache resources, and improve performance by serving cached content when possible. The server utilizes multithreading to handle concurrent client requests.

## Features

Caching: The proxy server caches resources based on cache directives in the HTTP header.

Multithreading: Handles multiple client requests simultaneously to improve responsiveness.

Error Handling: Provides basic error handling for client and cache-related issues.

## How the Proxy Server Works

Client Request Handling:

The proxy server listens for incoming client requests.
Upon receiving a request, it parses the HTTP request to extract the method, URI, and version.
It then checks if the requested resource is in the cache.

Cache Check:

If the requested resource is found in the cache and is still valid based on cache directives (e.g., 'max-age'), it serves the content from the cache to the client.
If the cache is outdated or not suitable, it proceeds to fetch the resource from the origin server.

Cache Miss:

If the requested resource is not in the cache or the cache is not suitable, the proxy server establishes a connection to the origin server.
It constructs a request to be sent to the origin server and forwards the client's request to the origin server.
Origin Server Response:

The proxy server receives the response from the origin server.
It checks the HTTP response code to determine if the content should be cached based on cacheable response codes (e.g., 200, 203, 206).
If caching is applicable, it saves the response in the cache.

Client Response:

The proxy server sends the received data (either from the cache or the origin server) back to the client.

Cleanup:

The proxy server closes connections appropriately and handles errors gracefully.

## Notes
Cacheable HTTP response codes include: 200, 203, 206, 300, 301, 410.
Cache expiration is determined by the 'max-age' directive in the header.

Please replace hostname and port with the actual hostname and port number you intend to use for the proxy server. This updated README provides a more detailed explanation of how the proxy server works without the removed sections.
